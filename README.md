# Project Description

The Smart Event Dashboard is a simple web-based application that allows users to add, display, and manage events dynamically.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript without using any external libraries or frameworks.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:

DOM Manipulation

Event Handling

Dynamic Element Creation

Clean UI Design using CSS

# Features
1️ Add Event

Users can add a new event using the form.
Each event includes:

Event Title

Event Date

Category

Description

The event is displayed dynamically as a card.

2️ Delete Single Event

Each event card contains a delete (x) button.
Clicking it removes that specific event from the dashboard.

3️ Clear All Events

The “Clear All Events” button removes all event cards at once.

4️ Add Sample Events

Predefined sample events can be added for demonstration purposes.

5️ DOM Manipulation Demo

When a user presses any key on the keyboard, the application displays:

You pressed: <key>
